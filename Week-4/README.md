## Covered so far ‚öôÔ∏è

Previous week we looked at another commonly employed technique in Astronomy i.e [Fourier Transforms.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) and use Lomb-scargle Periodogram to calculate the period of a Cepheid Variable Star. This week's module will be short and we will only look at handling [FITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS) images in Python and learn more about stacking images to enhance its resolution. 

## FITS Handling


FITS or Flexible Image Transport System most commonly used digital file format in astronomy. The FITS standard was designed specifically for astronomical data, and includes provisions such as describing photometric and spatial calibration information, together with image origin metadata. 

Below is a snapshot of [SAOImage DS9](https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9), one of the most commonly used FITS viewers.
