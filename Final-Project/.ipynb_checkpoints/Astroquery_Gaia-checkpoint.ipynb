Bailer-Jones et al. 2018 AJ 156:58, https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/aacb21. The catalogue provides distances estimates (and uncertainties therein) for 1.33 billion stars over the whole sky brighter than about G=20.7. These have been estimated using the parallaxes (and their uncertainties) from Gaia data release 2. A Bayesian procedure was used involving a prior with a single parameter L(l,b), which varies smoothly with Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The posterior is summarized with a point estimate (usually the mode) and a confidence interval (usually the 68% highest density interval). The estimation procedure is described in detail in the accompanying paper, which also analyses the catalogue content. The catalogue comprises one table with 1.33 billion rows and seven columns. The accompanying paper explains under what circumstances the different estimates/modality occur. These should not be mixed in any statistical analyses. Around 99.9% of all sources have result_flag=1 and modality_flag=1.\n",

Data replicated from gedr3dist.main table at GAVO Data Center TAP service https://dc.g-vo.org/tap and TAP metadata as of December 2020. <p>     Original table description. <p>     We estimate the distance from the Sun to sources in Gaia EDR3 that have     parallaxes. We provide two types of distance estimate, together with     their corresponding asymmetric uncertainties, using Bayesian posterior     density functions that we sample for each source. Our prior is based     on a detailed model of the 3D spatial, colour, and magnitude     distribution of stars in our Galaxy that includes a 3D map of     interstellar extinction. <p>     The first type of distance estimate is purely geometric, in that it only     makes use of the Gaia parallax and parallax uncertainty. This uses a     direction-dependent distance prior derived from our Galaxy model. The     second type of distance estimate is photogeometric: in addition to     parallax it also uses the source's G-band magnitude and BP-RP     colour. This type of estimate uses the geometric prior together with a     direction-dependent and colour-dependent prior on the absolute magnitude     of the star. <p>     Our distance estimate and uncertainties are quantiles, so are invariant     under logarithmic transformations. This means that our median estimate     of the distance can be used to give the median estimate of the distance     modulus, and likewise for the uncertainties.\n",
      "3 external.external.galex_ais                        The revised GALEX catalog of UV sources (GUVcat_AIS) from GR6+7 (82,992,086 sources). Reference: The ultraviolet sky: An overview from the GALEX surveys https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2013.07.045 Bibliographic Code: 2017ApJS..230...24B Table copied from TAP Vizier http://tapvizier.u-strasbg.fr/TAPVizieR/tap, table: II/335/galex_ais. Abstract: The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) imaged the sky in two ultraviolet (UV) bands, far-UV (FUV, lambda_eff∼1528A), and near-UV (NUV, lambda_eff∼2310A), delivering the first comprehensive sky surveys at these wavelengths. The GALEX database contains FUV and NUV images, ∼500 million source measurements and over 100000 low-resolution UV spectra. The UV surveys are a unique resource for statistical studies of hot stellar objects, z≲2 QSOs, star-forming galaxies, nebulae and the interstellar medium, and provide a roadmap for planning future UV instrumentation and follow-up observing programs. We present science-enhanced, \"clean\" catalogs of GALEX UV sources, with useful tags to facilitate scientific investigations. The catalogs are an improved and expanded version of our previous catalogs of UV sources (BCScat; Bianchi+, 2011, J/MNRAS/411/2770 ; II/312 and 2014AdSpR..53..900B 2014AdSpR..53..900B). With respect to BCScat, we have patched 640 fields for which the pipeline had improperly coadded non-overlapping observations, and we provide a version with a larger sky coverage (about 10%) by relaxing the restriction to the central area of the GALEX field to 1.1 deg diameter (GUVcatAISfov055: GUVcat_AIS FOV_radius <0.55 deg), as well as the cleaner, more restrictive version using only the 1 deg central portion of each field as in BCScat (GUVcatAISfov050: GUVcat_AIS FOV_radius <0.50 deg). We added new tags to facilitate selection and cleaning of statistical samples for science applications: we flag sources within the footprint of extended objects (nearby galaxies, stellar clusters) so that these regions can be excluded for estimating source density. As in our previous catalogs, in GUVcat duplicate measurements of the same source are removed, so that each astrophysical object has only one entry. Such a unique-source catalog is needed to study the density and distributions of sources, and to match UV sources with catalogs at other wavelengths. The catalog includes all observations from the All-Sky Imaging Survey (AIS), the survey with the largest area coverage, with both FUV and NUV detectors exposed: over 28700 fields, made up of a total of 57000 observations (\"visits\"). The total area covered, when overlaps are removed and gaps are accounted for, is 24790 square degrees for GUVcatAISfov055 (GUVcatAISfov055) and 22125 square degrees for (GUVcatAISfov050). The total numbers of \"unique\" AIS sources (eliminating duplicate measurements) are 82,992,086 (GUVcatAISfov055) and 69,772,677 (GUVcatAISfov050). The typical depth of the GUVcat_AIS catalog is FUV=19.9, NUV=20.8 AB mag.\n",

As described in the detailed description of attribute designation in GaiaSource it is not guaranteed that the same astronomical source will always have the same source identifier in different Data Releases. Hence the only safe way to compare source records between different Data Releases in general is to check the records of proximal source(s) in the same small part of the sky. This table provides the means to do this via a precomputed crossmatch of such sources, taking into account the proper motions available at DR2.  Within the neighbourhood of a given DR2 source there may be none, one or (rarely) several possible counterparts in DR1 indicated by rows in this table. This occasional source confusion was introduced during the DR1 processing which used an earlier version of the software for matching of transit observations to unique astrophysical sources. The subsequent merging, splitting and deletion of identifiers introduced at DR1 during the DR2 processing means there is no guaranteed one–to–one correspondence in source identifiers between the releases.  For more details of the procedure used to create this crossmatch, see Section [chap:xmdr1] in the online documentation.\n",

      "80 gaiadr2.gaiadr2.panstarrs1_original_valid          The Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) is a system for wide-field astronomical imaging developed and operated by the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii. Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) is the first part of Pan-STARRS to be completed and is the basis for Data Release 1 (DR1). The PS1 survey used a 1.8 meter telescope and its 1.4 Gigapixel camera to image the sky in five broadband filters (g, r, i, z, y).  The current table contains a filtered subsample of the 10 723 304 629 entries listed in the original ObjectThin table. We used only ObjectThin and MeanObject tables to extract panstarrs1OriginalValid table, this means that objects detected only in stack images are not included here. The main reason for us to avoid the use of objects detected in stack images is that their astrometry is not as good as the mean objects astrometry: “The stack positions (raStack, decStack) have considerably larger systematic astrometric errors than the mean epoch positions (raMean, decMean).” The astrometry for the MeanObject positions uses Gaia DR1 as a reference catalog, while the stack positions use 2MASS as a reference catalog.  In details, we filtered out all objects where:  -   nDetections = 1  -   no good quality data in Pan-STARRS, objInfoFlag 33554432 not set  -   mean astrometry could not be measured, objInfoFlag 524288 set  -   stack position used for mean astrometry, objInfoFlag 1048576 set  -   error on all magnitudes equal to 0 or to -999;  -   all magnitudes set to -999;  -   error on RA or DEC greater than 1 arcsec.  The number of objects in panstarrs1OriginalValid is 2 264 263 282.  The panstarrs1OriginalValid table contains only a subset of the columns available in the combined ObjectThin and MeanObject tables.

Note that this is the commanded attitude of the spacecraft, the actual attitude could deviate from it by up to about 30 arcsec. Also, it does not contain any of the data interruptions that occurred during the real mission, of which the main ones are listed in Chapter [chap:cu0int], Section [cu0int_sec:release_framework].  The scanning law has been sampled at a 10 second interval, in which the satellite rotates about 10 arcminutes (the target spin rate is actually 59.9641857803 arcsec/sec). Note that this is several times shorter than a typical field-of-view transit and the scan position angle will be practically constant during this interval.  Notes:  -   The times in columns 1, 2 and 3 are in Julian days in TCB with time     origin 2010-01-01T00:00 (JD 2455197.5), following the time     coordinate convention used in the Gaia archive. TCB stands for     Barycentric Coordinate Time and is the time standard used in Gaia     processing, equivalent to the proper time experienced by a clock at     rest in a coordinate frame co-moving with the barycentre of the     Solar system but outside its gravity well, therefore not influenced     by the gravitational time dilation caused by the Sun and the rest of     the solar system.  -   Column 1 is the reference time for the spacecraft attitude, while     columns 2 and 3 give the times with the (relativistic) corrections     applied for the light-travel time to the solar system barycentre,     corresponding to an infinitely distant source at the RA, DEC at the     centres of FOV 1 and 2, respectively.  -   FOV1 and FOV2 correspond to the preceding (PFOV) and following     (FFOV) fields-of-view, respectively.  -   The centres of the field of views are separated by the basic angle     of 106.5 deg, see Fig. 2 of . Their origin in the focal plane is     illustrated in Fig. 3 of the same paper: both originate in the     astrometric field (AF) 7, with FOV1 in row 3 and FOV2 in row 5.  -   The scan angle, theta, is the position angle of the direction in     which the FOV is moving (also called ‘along-scan’ direction), and is     defined in the usual astronomical sense: theta = 0 when the FoV is     moving towards local North, and theta = 90 degrees towards local     East.  -   All values have been formatted to the default double numerical     precision and so this precision should not be interpreted as the     accuracy of the data.\n",

The Tycho Double Star Catalogue, (TDSC, ) contains 98482 components of double and multiple systems processed in the Tycho-2 context. It includes either original Tycho-2 data or results from a dedicated re-processing aimed at binaries. As pointed out by P. Marrese (personal communication), the TDSC star with identifier 29583 is redundant and it was therefore skipped. The TDSC supplement contains data from an additional 4777 components from either Hipparcos or Tycho-1.  The Tycho-2 main catalogue  contains 2539913 sources, including many binaries, but a minimum separation of 0.8 arcsec was imposed during the catalogue construction. The Tycho-2 supplement-1 contains data for 17588 Hipparcos and Tycho-1 stars, which do not appear in the main catalogue, but only the 4777 stars relevant for TDSC are included here. The Tycho-2 supplement-2 contains an additional 1146 Tycho-1 stars of poor quality.  We have merged Tycho-2 (main) with the TDSC main and supplement, keeping the Tycho-2 data model and extending it to include TDSC–specific fields. This is only possible to a certain degree as specified in detail below. In particular, Tycho-2 includes fields for mean position, proper motion etc. for a combination of Tycho-2 and several ground based catalogues. These fields are inherited for TDSC main stars, but were not derived for the TDSC supplement, where we only provide HIP proper motions. For Tycho-2 stars not in TDSC, blank TDSC fields were appended.  For Tycho-2 stars in TDSC, the following fields were replaced by the corresponding TDSC fields:  -   tyc1, tyc2, tyc3;  -   hip;  -   ccdm.  In addition, if the TDSC contains a new solution:  -   btMag, eBtMag, vtMag, eVtMag, raDeg, deDeg, epRa1990, epDe1990,     eRaDeg, eDeDec;  -   The mean position flag, pflag, is set to ‘P’ (“photocentre\") if     resolved and there are Tycho-2 mean positions. Mean position     etc. are then repeated for both new components;  -   The proximity indicator, prox, is set to blank if the Tycho-2 star     was resolved in TDSC;  -   The type-of-solution flag, posflg, set to ‘N’;  -   For resolved Tycho-2 stars, two records are given.  For the few TDSC stars with new solutions, but not in Tycho-2, and for the TDSC supplement stars (Hipparcos or Tycho-1), the Tycho-2 part of the merged record was populated in the following way:  -   TYC1..3 from TDSC;  -   pflag set to TDSC pmflg (‘H’ or ‘X’), ‘H’ indicating Hip proper     motions;  -   no mean position and related fields;  -   proper motions only for Hipparcos stars;  -   $B_{\\rm T}, V_{\\rm T}$ photometry from TDSC;  -   Tycho-1 flag, tyc, is set to posflg, i.e. ‘T’ or ‘H’ although     Hipparcos stars may well be in Tycho-1;  -   Hipparcos, hip, and CCDM, ccdm, identifiers from TDSC;  -   astrometry from TDSC, but the (ra, dec)-correlation, corr, is set to     blank.  New TDSC specific fields added after the Tycho-2 part of the record:  -   sysNo, cmp, nMain, nSup, magflg, wds, note, hd;  -   rcmp, pa, sep, ePa, ePaSep, eSep.\n",

Astrophys. 474, 653 (2007) http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20078357  A new reduction of the astrometric data as produced by the Hipparcos     mission has been published, claiming accuracies for nearly all stars     brighter than magnitude Hp=8 to be better, by up to a factor 4, than     in the original catalogue.      The new Hipparcos astrometric catalogue is checked for the quality of     the data and the consistency of the formal errors as well as the     possible presence of error correlations. The differences with the     earlier publication are explained.      Methods. The internal errors are followed through the reduction     process, and the external errors are investigated on the basis of a     comparison with radio observations of a small selection of stars, and     the distribution of negative parallaxes. Error correlation levels are     investigated and the reduction by more than a factor 10 as obtained in     the new catalogue is explained.      Results. The formal errors on the parallaxes for the new catalogue are     confirmed. The presence of a small amount of additional noise, though     unlikely, cannot be ruled out.      Conclusions. The new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data     provides an improvement by a factor 2.2 in the total weight compared     to the catalogue published in 1997, and provides much improved data     for a wide range of studies on stellar luminosities and local galactic     kinematics.\n",

I/239))     collected  by the  star mapper  of the  ESA Hipparcos  satellite,  but     Tycho-2 is much bigger  and slightly  more precise,   owing to  a more     advanced   reduction  technique.   Components  of  double  stars  with     separations down to 0.8 arcsec are included. Proper motions precise to     about 2.5 mas/yr are given as  derived  from  a  comparison  with  the     Astrographic   Catalogue  and   143  other   ground-based  astrometric     catalogues,  all reduced to the Hipparcos celestial coordinate system.     Tycho-2  supersedes in most applications Tycho-1,   as well as the ACT     (Cat.  I/246)  and TRC  (Cat. I/250)  catalogues based on Tycho-1.     Supplement-1  lists stars  from the  Hipparcos and  Tycho-1 Catalogues     which are not in Tycho-2.  Supplement-2 lists 1146 Tycho-1 stars which     are probably either false or heavily disturbed.
