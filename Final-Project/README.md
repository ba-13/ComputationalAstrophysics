Hi there! Hope your endsems went crazy awesome! (_which, by the way, is sarcastic :)_). So now as we step in the last week of *Project: Computational Astrophysics*, we present you the final project, where you would be brushing up your learning and using all the knowledge you had require to complete some tasks, mentioned in the `Final_Project.pdf` file.

All the best! Feel free to ping for any doubt.
