## Assignment 1

Given .ipynb file, with problem statements as

- Estimating the distance of a cluster with data provided in form of apparent brightness.
- Plotting HMXB and LMXB observed by AstroSAT's catalogue in mollweide projection.

---

## Assignment 2

Given .ipynb file, with problem statements as

- With the concept of cross-matching, find which messiers the given RA-DEC data points to.
- Estimate chirp mass of a binary system, by analysis of the observations from LIGO GW150914.
- Phase Folding and applying Lomb-Scargle Periodogram on a Cephied variable, `OGLE-LMC-CEP-0016`.

## Assignment 3 (Final Project)

Given 4 problem Statements [here](./Final-Project/Final_Project.pdf), We had to do a case study on the cluster, Pleiades [M-45](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades).  
This involved determining some of the parameters for the cluster's stars:

- Absolute Magnitude
- Luminosity
- Effective Radius
- Effective Temperature
- Plot the cluster on the basis of RA, DEC and Brightness
- Plot the HR Diagram to Predict the Turnoff Point of the Cluster

Given Data for calculating the above were:

- Relative Magnitude
- RA, Dec
- Plx (parallax)
- BP_RP Values

All of which are observables.
